# OD matrices for crowd shipping applications

OD matrices of people and cargo for CrowdShipping applications and algorithm testing

Files:

- OD matrices.xlsx: This file provides realistic people and freight OD matrices for the Italian city of Trento. The matrices are symmetric, i.e. the demand rates between the pairs (i,j) and (j,i) are the same in each time period.
More specifically, the entries provide the hourly rates for passengers and freight in the peak period (worksheet "Peak") and in the off-peak period (worksheet "Off-peak").
- Area with/without background: snapshot of the area under consideration.
- zone shapefiles.rar: set of shapefiles, in different formats, related to the city of Trento (IT).
